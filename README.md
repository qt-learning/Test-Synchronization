App_test_synchronization_sections_2_to_6: Qt application used as the AUT for sections 2 through 6. The application loads a popup by clicking a button. The popup takes about 0.5 seconds to load which is used to demonstrate test synchronization. Requieres Qt 6.5, tested with with Qt 6.5.2 MinGw 64-bit

App_test_synchronization_section7: Qt application used as the AUT for section 7. The application has a few basic components and opens a dialog with a button. Used to demonstrate how to react to events and signals coming from the AUT. Requieres Qt 6.5, tested with with Qt 6.5.2 MinGw 64-bit

suite_test_synchronization_section2: Example to demonstrate how to use set time based synchronization points. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.

suite_test_synchronization_section3: Examples to demonstrate how to use object based synchronization point and implement a callback functions for waitForObject(). Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.

suite_test_synchronization_section4: Example to demonstrate how to to set image based synchronization points. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.

suite_test_synchronization_section5: Example to demonstrate how to to set text based synchronization points. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.

suite_test_synchronization_section6: Example to demonstrate how to set condition based synchronization points. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.

suite_test_synchronization_section7: Examples to demonstrate how to create and install both signal and event handlers. Tested with "Squish for Qt 7.2.0" package that supports Qt 6.5 applications built with MinGW 64-bit.
